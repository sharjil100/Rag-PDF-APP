### 3. **Auto-scroll**

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### **Message Flow:**
1. User types in the input box
2. User presses Enter or clicks Send
3. User message is added to `messages` array immediately
4. Input is cleared
5. Loading indicator appears
6. Backend API is called: `GET /chat?message=<query>`
7. AI response is received
8. AI message is added to `messages` array
9. Chat auto-scrolls to bottom

### **API Integration:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:8000/chat?message=${encodeURIComponent(userMessage)}`
);
const data = await response.json();
// data.message contains the AI response
// data.docs contains the retrieved PDF chunks
```
